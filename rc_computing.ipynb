    "RIT's RC cluster is run through slurm which is a software orchestration tool and works by getting jobs from its user. Think of slurm as like an admin to whom you are submitting code that runs. ***NOTE*** that the cluster is not meant for debugging. You should only submit jobs to the cluster when you are sure that your code runs locally. The cluster is meant to run your code over multiple cpu and gpu cores, which you probably don't have available in your local computer. And that is the reason, the cluster uses SLURM."
